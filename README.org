* RayCast
  A retro raycaster written in Haskell and C. 
 
  + Textured walls
  + Textured floors and ceilings 
  + crude collision against walls detection
  
  
* TODOs 
  + Figure out how to Profile (SDL library made for profiling needed).
  + Colision agains walls needs improvement.  
  + Add "sprites" (for items and enemies) 
    Copy the sprite code from RayPortal. 
  + Add Doors 
  + Lighting (lightmaps most likely) 

* Notes 
  + The Haskell floor function was extremely slow. All calls to floor 
    have been replaced by calls to floor_ and floori_. Both of those 
    are implemented using the C floorf function and the FFI.
